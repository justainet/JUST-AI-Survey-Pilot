          Thank you for joining the JUST AI community. The following pages will take you through a reflective survey that invites you to think about your interest and involvement in AI and data ethics work. This process tries to encompass the many ways each of us approaches and contributes to this endeavor.<Br><br>
          When you finish the process, you’ll be able to see a reflection of how your contributions appear in relation to others who have also gone through this process. We’ll also identify some ways that you can continue to connect with others, meet people who might be interesting, and keep up with JUST AI endeavors.</Br></p>
